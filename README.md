##This project focuses on designing the front-end of an e-learning platform that provides an engaging and user-friendly interface for learners. The platform is built using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring sections for course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding to enhance the learning experience.

Key features include:

Course Listing: Displays available courses with details like title, description, and category.

Progress Tracking: Allows learners to monitor their completion status and learning journey.

Video Embedding: Integrates educational videos directly within the platform for easy access.

Responsive Layout: Ensures seamless usage across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

This front-end design creates a foundation for interactive online learning, making education more accessible and organized for students.
